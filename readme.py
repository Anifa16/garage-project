#Anifa was in charge of the first portion of the project by adding in the class function all the way down to the first instince. Anifa was like Lebron James as she went above and beyond in this project. 

#Moe was in charge of the halfway portion of the project to the end and by wrapping it all up in the terminal to meet the requirements. Moe was like Kyrie Irving and was there to faciliate and clean up the project to make sure there are no errors.
